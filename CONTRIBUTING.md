# Contributing

The first thing you'll want to do is clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/alvincrespo/turbo-form-rails.git
```

Once the repo is cloned, switch to your project.

When you're in your projects directory, update your `GEMFILE` with:

```ruby
gem "turbo_form", path: "../turbo-form-rails"
```

Finally, run bundler:

```
bundle
```

Now you're ready to start testing your updates!
